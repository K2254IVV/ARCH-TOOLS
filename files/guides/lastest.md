# 1. Set the console keyboard layout and font

The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:
```bash
localectl list-keymaps
```

To set the keyboard layout, pass its name to loadkeys(1). For example, to set a German keyboard layout:
```bash
loadkeys de-latin1
```

# 1.1. Verify the boot mode

To verify the boot mode, check the UEFI bitness:
```bash
cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
```

- If the command returns 64, the system is booted in UEFI mode and has a 64-bit x64 UEFI.
- If the command returns 32, the system is booted in UEFI mode and has a 32-bit IA32 UEFI. While this is supported, it will limit the boot loader choice to those that support mixed mode booting.
- If it returns No such file or directory, the system may be booted in BIOS (or CSM) mode.
If the system did not boot in the mode you desired (UEFI vs BIOS), refer to your motherboard's manual.

# 1.2. Ethernet
To set up a network connection in the live environment, go through the following steps:

Ensure your network interface is listed and enabled, for example with ip-link:
```bash
ip link # or "ip a"
# dhpcd {device}
# or iwctl
```
For wireless and WWAN, make sure the card is not blocked with rfkill.
Connect to the network:
Ethernet—plug in the cable.
Wi-Fi—authenticate to the wireless network using iwctl.
Mobile broadband modem—connect to the mobile network with the mmcli utility.
The connection may be verified with ping:
```bash
ping ping.archlinux.org
```

---
# 1.3. Time & Data
To Sync The Time run this commands in terminal:
```bash
timedatectl
data
```

---
# 1.4. Partition the disks
When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a block device such as /dev/sda, /dev/nvme0n1 or /dev/mmcblk0. To identify these devices, use lsblk or fdisk.
```bash
fdisk -l
```
Results ending in rom, loop or airootfs may be ignored. mmcblk* devices ending in rpmb, boot0 and boot1 can be ignored.
